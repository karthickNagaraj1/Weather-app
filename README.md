🌧️☀️ What’s the weather like in your city right now?
I just built a Weather App using React + OpenWeatherMap API to help you find out instantly! 🧑‍💻⚡

This was a fun weekend project where I learned a lot about:
✅ Working with APIs using Axios
✅ Managing component state in React
✅ Styling fast with Tailwind CSS
✅ Handling user input and errors gracefully

🔎 Just type your city name and get:

Weather conditions (like "Cloudy", "Rainy" etc.)

Temperature in Celsius 🌡️
